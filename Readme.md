Continuum Reporting
===

**Summer 2016 Internship Project**

Take a look at the [final report](/examples/markdown/Continuum\ Reporting.md)!

## Project Description

Essentially my partner and I had to conceptualize, map out, and then scale how might high school students explore and decide on their college options.

> Using design thinking to look at how ACT might scale helpful, supportive conversation  using continuum reporting artifacts.
> - Kate to focus on the design thinking framework
> - Ryan to focus on the visualization of data
>
> Focus is how to structure a supportive conversation, fill in "what's next" after student's get their ACT results back.

## Notebooks

I did most of my work in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). I tried to document my work as best as I could. The notebooks have been converted to Markdown, so you can browse online.
